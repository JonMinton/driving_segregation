# Code and additional details for Minton & Clark (2018), "Driving Segregation: Age, Gender and Emerging Inequalities", in Curl & Musselwhite (Eds.), *Geographies of Transport and Ageing*. 

## Introduction

This github repository contains the code used to produce the results described in our contribution to [Curl & Musselwhite's *Geographies of Transport and Ageing*](https://www.palgrave.com/gp/book/9783319763590#aboutBook)

## Code 

The analyses were produced in the R programming language. 

The main R script used to prepare the data is [here.](https://github.com/JonMinton/driving_segregation/blob/master/scripts/manage_data_bhps.R). 

The R script used to produce the figures (except those which were manually edited afterwards) is [here](https://github.com/JonMinton/driving_segregation/blob/master/scripts/create_graphs.R). 

## Data used

The [British Household Panel Survey](https://www.iser.essex.ac.uk/bhps) was used in the analyses.
